repoxMessage = REPOX is a framework to manage metadata spaces. It comprises several channels to import metadata from data providers, services to transform metadata between schemas according to user's specified rules, and services to expose the results to the exterior. This tailored version of REPOX aims to provide to all the TEL and Europeana partners a simple solution to import, convert and expose their bibliographic data via OAI-PMH. We work hard to provide you with a reliable system, even though you may experience small hiccups from time to time.<br/>If you have ideas how to improve REPOX, have a question related to the platform, or want to report a problem: <b>Please, let us know. Here.
